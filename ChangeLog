    Unreleased

    * Allow import/export to tarball as well as directory
    * Don't write files in one go when bulk exporting
    * Fix surveyindices likelihood component, should be able to output multiple stocknames
    * Add gadget_stockfile_initialconditions and gadget_stockfile_recruitment
    * Add gadget_stockfile_extremes and gadget_stockfile_refweight for manipulating stockfiles
    * Allow files in subdirectories to be read and then rewritten in the same place

    Version 2.0-0

    * Bulk-load prey data, speeding up stomach import
    * Should use name to compare new/old items in taxonomies, not id
    * Give meaningful errors (or just sort it) when lists are handed to gadget_likelihood_function
    * ANALYZE only our tables, so we don't trigger warnings
    * Don't match partial names (e.g. age --> maturity_stage) when importing data
    * Autodiscover min and max for 'all' columns
    * Only recreate new temporary tables for groups once
    * Use arbitary 1:100 for 'all' aggregation
    * Correct spelling of surveyindices
    * Add mfdb_survey_index_mean, for retrieving acoustic indicies
    * Query functions should always return a list of data.frames, even if there is no data
    * Implement catchinkilos likelihood component
    * Give examples of invalid data if import fails
    * Add surveyindicies, migrationpenalty likelihood components
    * Allow specifying an abundance_index when fetching mean length
    * Add survey_index table and index_type taxonomy, to store acoustic data
    * Add mfdb_import_cs_taxonomy, to allow changing any of the taxonomies
    * Remove the distinction between survey data and survey metadata

    Version 1.1-0

    * Base aggreations for open intervals and unaggreated data on returned data
    * Fix iceland example so we only include each subdivision once
    * Add an example for using bootstrapping
    * Inspect data.frame columns when making a likelihood component
    * Allow writing to alternative likelihood files
    * When grouping by vectors with taxonomies, don't return integer values
    * Need temperature to 1 dp
    * More notes on how to install under windows
    * Rework mfdb()'s ability to guess where DB is

    * Don't overload as.list for mfdb_aggregates, use an internal generic
      function instead
    * Fix sampling for bootstrap groups
    * Should run pre_query and from_clause for filter_cols too, just in case
      they are an mfdb_group
    * Use DB to find out case study ID---might be a remote DB
    * R CMD check fixes
