    * Add CNR-IAMC to institute list
    * Remove need for specifying fleetname in data for gadget_fleet_component, it makes no sense
    * mfdb_step_interval must be integer, it's not going to work otherwise
    * Add support for fleet files
    * Fix bootstrapping when multiple group columns are used
    * Notice if a query function is given a non-list params

    Version 3.1-0

    * Fix weighted mean function when scaling by an index
    * Make aggregationlevel in catchbykilos automatic
    * Allow import of "weight_total", for total biomass

2015-03-16  Jamie Lentin  <lentinj@shuttlethread.com>

    Version 3.0-0

    Schema changes:
    * Allow non-integer counts to be stored, when they have been normalised by haul-length, e.g.
    * Allow count to be NA, when storing biomass from landings
    * Make fleet a CS taxonomy, so you can have custom fleets

2015-04-15  Jamie Lentin  <lentinj@shuttlethread.com>

    Version 2.1-0

    * Implement weighted stddev aggregate function (ignoring _var columns for now)
    * Use survey indices to scale count, not replace it
    * Support grouping of taxonomy items
    * Allow import/export to tarball as well as directory
    * Don't write files in one go when bulk exporting
    * Fix surveyindices likelihood component, should be able to output multiple stocknames
    * Add gadget_stockfile_initialconditions and gadget_stockfile_recruitment
    * Add gadget_stockfile_extremes and gadget_stockfile_refweight for manipulating stockfiles
    * Allow files in subdirectories to be read and then rewritten in the same place
    * Introduce "bare components" file type, use this to include temperature

2015-03-10  Jamie Lentin  <lentinj@shuttlethread.com>

    Version 2.0-0

    * Bulk-load prey data, speeding up stomach import
    * Should use name to compare new/old items in taxonomies, not id
    * Give meaningful errors (or just sort it) when lists are handed to gadget_likelihood_function
    * ANALYZE only our tables, so we don't trigger warnings
    * Don't match partial names (e.g. age --> maturity_stage) when importing data
    * Autodiscover min and max for 'all' columns
    * Only recreate new temporary tables for groups once
    * Use arbitary 1:100 for 'all' aggregation
    * Correct spelling of surveyindices
    * Add mfdb_survey_index_mean, for retrieving acoustic indicies
    * Query functions should always return a list of data.frames, even if there is no data
    * Implement catchinkilos likelihood component
    * Give examples of invalid data if import fails
    * Add surveyindicies, migrationpenalty likelihood components
    * Allow specifying an abundance_index when fetching mean length
    * Add survey_index table and index_type taxonomy, to store acoustic data
    * Add mfdb_import_cs_taxonomy, to allow changing any of the taxonomies
    * Remove the distinction between survey data and survey metadata

2015-01-14  Jamie Lentin  <lentinj@shuttlethread.com>

    Version 1.1-1

    * Add path to Debian/Ubuntu Postgres socket

2015-01-09  Jamie Lentin  <lentinj@shuttlethread.com>

    Version 1.1-0

    * Base aggreations for open intervals and unaggreated data on returned data
    * Fix iceland example so we only include each subdivision once
    * Add an example for using bootstrapping
    * Inspect data.frame columns when making a likelihood component
    * Allow writing to alternative likelihood files
    * When grouping by vectors with taxonomies, don't return integer values
    * Need temperature to 1 dp
    * More notes on how to install under windows
    * Rework mfdb()'s ability to guess where DB is

    * Don't overload as.list for mfdb_aggregates, use an internal generic
      function instead
    * Fix sampling for bootstrap groups
    * Should run pre_query and from_clause for filter_cols too, just in case
      they are an mfdb_group
    * Use DB to find out case study ID---might be a remote DB
    * R CMD check fixes
